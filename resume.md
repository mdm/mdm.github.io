Hi, my name is Marc Dominik Migge. I'm a software developer from Cologne, Germany and this is my blog/portfolio. In my free time I enjoy playing Go and learning foreign languages - especially Japanese.

You can contact me via email: [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}). I'm not very active on social media.

This website is mainly about programming, but if you want to know a little bit more about my other passions, read on.

Go
--

I started playing [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) in October 2004, after picking up a set of stones and a board during a trip to China. I began playing in tournaments soon after and [rose to 4k](http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/Player_Card.php?&key=13837912) in about two years. Unfortunately, I didn't improve much after that. Mostly due to my inconsistent reading abilities and lack of joseki knowledge. However, I'm still chasing the dream of becoming a dan player one day. Online, I used to play a lot on [KGS](http://www.gokgs.com/) as "[mdm](http://kgs.gosquares.net/index.rhtml.en?id=mdm&r=1)". However, lately I like the agressive playing style of the Asian servers ([Tygem](http://www.tygemgo.com/), [Fox](http://weiqi.qq.com/), etc.) better and usually play there on weekends.

Foreign Languages
-----------------

My first foreign language was English. It was mandatory in school, but it was not until I discovered the internet and programming in my teens, that it became my favorite and most useful subject. In 1998 I had the chance to attend [Sidcot School](http://www.sidcot.org.uk/) for one term. That was one of the best experiences in my life and it deepened my love for the language. Nowadays, I consider myself fluent, but of course there is always more to learn.

While in high school I also dabbled in French and Italian a bit, but I never got very far with those languages.

Then, when I was in university, I discovered Japanese. Not a very useful language compared to English, but all the more interesting. I picked Japanese as my secondary subject, but switched after two years of studying. The truth is, I sucked at Japanese. But I was hooked. I continued to study Japanese in my spare time and over the course of the next few years I slowly improved. I finished the [Genki](http://genki.japantimes.co.jp/index_en) series and started to seriously tackle [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) using the [Heisig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi) method. In 2014 I started to take evening classes in Japanese. The classes are easy, but I realized that studying with other people is very good for my motivation. In 2016 I passed the N3 level of the [JLPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test).

Finally, I also study a little bit of Chinese. But to make real progress on that, I would have to seriously improve my pronounciation and I'm not quite sure how to do that in my limited spare time.
